----------Project Overview------------------

This project is an implementation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, developed using Visual Basic (VB6). The game includes player-controlled movement, asteroid spawning, collision detection, scoring, and game state management.

The repository contains both the original starter code and my modified and completed implementation. The files listed below represent the final, working version of the game.

The following files make up the final version of the Asteroids game and should be used together to run the completed project:

ASTEROIDS.vbp – Visual Basic project file

Module3.bas – Core game logic and shared procedures

frmGame3.frm – Main game form

frmGame3.frx – Resource file for the game form

frmStart3.frm – Start/menu screen form

frmStart3.frx – Resource file for the start form
